# Infra repo

Repository for my infrastructure defined as code.

Primarily Ansible right now, but I plan on implementing Terraform to define the virtual machine state as well soon™.

Thanks to @ironicbadger for his excellent [docker compose generator role](https://github.com/ironicbadger/ansible-role-docker-compose-generator).
